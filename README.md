Problem – 1a

In order to solve this problem, we must take a Python input from the console, remove at least two letters, then output the remaining characters as a reversed string. Thus, I assign a variable "m" first, wait for user input, and set another variable "n" to Python to confirm that the user entered the correct string. Next, I used the replace() function to swap out two letters in the string. Finally, I use the extended slice function, where the -1 in the step indicates that the string starts at the beginning and ends at the end, reversing the string and printing the result.

This problem simply asks us to get two numbers and perform 4 arithmetic operations on them, so i choose 2 numbers as input "num1" and "num2" and perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on them and print their respective outputs.

Problem – 2

This problem asks us to take an input from the user and replace any "python" present in the sentence to "pythons", so I just use the simple replace () function to replace the "python"  to "pythons".

Problem – 3

This problem asks us to get class grade as an input and give out the grades as output using if else statements, so i use the variable "NN_class_score" to get the input from the user and construct an if else ladder so that the appropriate grades are displayed as outputs.
